# Sudoku-Solver

#Description-
This Project works as a sudoku-solver which takes input as unsolved matrix and outputs the solved matrix.
I used the basics of python in this, using the backtracking and recursion techniques.
I further plan to add digital sudoku solver as I learn more.

#Instructions-
The input values should be given Row wise with a space in between.
Further helpful instructions are added in the code file.
